# TwitterOpenToWork
Essentially the app is meant to allow a user to sign in, it will automatically pull their profile picture. Then it will apply the LinkedIn "OpenToWork", and upload the new profile picture automatically.

This is a gag idea that I'm trying to get to work for fun. I think the current X api is recognizing me as a bad actor. 

Need to debug some more, but I wanted to get some more of the fun ideas I have up publicly.
